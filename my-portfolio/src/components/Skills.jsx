 My journey started when a friend of mine introduced me into tech. I have a laptop and i saw it as an opportunity to learn a good and profitable skill. I made lot of research on which stack to venture into. I am someone who loves design,creativity and would want to develop experiences that make people's live simple. I used resources like freecodecamp,w3schools as a beginner and practiced immensely. Later on, i enrolled in a bootcamp, now i can create a responsive functioning website and im so much happy about it.
